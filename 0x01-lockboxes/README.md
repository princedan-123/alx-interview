<p>This tutorial project is about implementing lockboxes algorithm. The function <function name> implements the algorithm. it receives a list of lists where each list in the outer list represents a box. Each list has memebers or is empty. The members of each list represents keys that may open another box. BY opening another box we mean if an element in one list is equal to the index of another. </p>
<p>Note that by default the first list in the list is assumed to be opened and the list is assumed to be composed of positive integers
 </p>
<p> if all the boxes can be opened the function is expected to return True else False is returned. </p>
<h3> My implementation </h3>
<p> comming soon as README is still in progress. </p>
